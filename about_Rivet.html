        <h1>about_Rivet</h1>

    <p>Rivet is a database migration/change management/versioning tool inspired by 
Ruby on Rails' Migrations. It creates and applies migration scripts for SQL 
Server databases. Migration scripts describe changes to make to your 
database, e.g. add a table, add a column, remove an index, etc. Migrations 
scripts should get added to your version control system so they can be 
packaged and deployed with your application's code.    </p>

<p>Every Rivet migration is really a PowerShell script with a special name and<br />
that contains two migration functions.  The migration filename should have 
the format <code>&lt;timestamp&gt;_&lt;description&gt;.ps1</code>.  Timestamp is a unique number 
which increases every time a new migration is created.  By default, Rivet 
uses a timestamp with second precision.  <code>Description</code> is a short description 
of what the migration is doing.     </p>

<p>There should be two functions inside a migration, <code>Push-Migration</code> and 
<code>Pop-Migration</code>.  The <code>Push-Migration</code> function should make changes to the 
database.  The <code>Pop-Migration</code> function should reverse those changes, so you 
can put the database back in the state it was in before it was migrated. </p>

<p>Once released, migrations are immutable and should not be changed.  Rivet 
keeps track of which migrations have been applied against a database.  If you 
change a migration once it has been applied to a database, it won't get 
re-applied because Rivet has already recorded that it was applied.  Create a 
new migration to make the new change.</p>

<p>All changes made in either <code>Push-Migration</code> or <code>Pop-Migration</code> are wrapped in 
a transaction.  If any change fails to get made/applied, all changes are 
rolled back.</p>
